# Leetcode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems and challenges. Each problem is solved in a separate code file, and this README.md file serves as a guide to understand the repository structure and keep track of the problems solved.

## [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
### Problem
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value. You need to return the indices of these two numbers.
It is guaranteed that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)
### Problem
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
